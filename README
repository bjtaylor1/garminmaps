Known prerequisites:
git default-jre ant subversion

Ubuntu: run 'sudo apt-get install <prerequisites>'
Redhat: run 'sudo yum install <prerequisites>'

Edit makefile, change space-separated list of countries to what you want in your maps.
(Use monaco and/or liechtenstein to test, as they are tiny and it won't take long.)

Leave style as 'clean', or to use your own style:
	Make a copy of styles/default or styles/clean as styles/<yourstyle>
		(note '<yourstyle>' is a directory)
	Edit the files in the style according to preference (see mkgmap docs online)
	Change 'style=clean' in the makefile to 'style=<yourstyle>'

Run 'make dependencies' and 'make gmapsupp.img', and optionally, 'make clean'.

Copy gmapsupp.img to the Garmin folder of your device.
